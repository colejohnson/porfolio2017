            I’m a 21-year-old Human Centered Computing Student at the Rochester Institute of
            Technology. Originally from the small truck-stop town of Tok, Alaska, I moved to Rochester, New York three
            years ago.
            <br><br>
            My path to design has many twists and turns.
            <br><br>
            I started freshman year as a computer science major, transitioned to Web and Mobile Computing in search
            of more user interaction, and found myself being one of the first transfers into the newly launched
            Human Centered Computing program. Design to me is communication, and each major I've been in exposed me
            to the idea of design in different fields, like a language in different dialects. But now I feel as
            though I've found my spot in the college, and not a moment too soon. There is a much to learn and much
            to pursue.
            <br><br>
            I have found numerous opportunities to contribute and lead here at RIT and in the city of Rochester. At
            our college radio station WITR, I conduct social media, press, and promotional material as Promotions
            Director. I also host a weekly two-hour radio show on Sunday nights, helping provide a soundtrack for
            studying students burning the midnight oil. I was elected President of a budding Human Centered
            Computing club, and plan on holding instructional campus-wide workshops throughout the semester. Outside
            of school, I participate in the Rochester Chapter of the National Stuttering Association as Chapter
            Leader, leading monthly group meetings for stutterers and speech pathology students. In the late hours,
            I'm feeding my remaining passion to starting a clothing brand with a good friend of mine. Almost a year
            in the making, we're planning for the first release in late February.
            <br><br>
            In college, I have discovered myself to be a fast-moving individual with a hankering to create, explore,
            and get involved. I pursue my passions and know well the value in hard, consistent effort. Take a
            peek at my résumé and feel free to get in touch!
